Kitten Automator
================

This is a tool to automate some aspects of [Kittens Game][kittens], especially
with an eye towards making the game more idle-friendly.

Installation
------------

If you already have [Greasemonkey][] installed, [**click here**][install] to
install. Then it will run every time you load the game. If you install this
way, by default Greasemonkey will automatically update the script.

Otherwise, you could paste this into Firefox's scratch pad. It works fine there
too, but you'll need to run it manually every time you reload the page, and it
won't automatically update.
